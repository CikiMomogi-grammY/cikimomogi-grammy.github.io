Because you most likely don\u2019t want to do that with your laptop, you should upload your code to a <em>hosting provider</em> (in other words, someone else\u2019s computer, also known as a <em>server</em>), and let those people run it for you.</p><p>There are countless companies that let you run your Telegram bot for free. This documentation covers a number of different hosting providers that we know work well with grammY (check the Hosting section). In the end, however, the choice of which provider to pick is up to you. Remember that running your code somewhere else means that whoever owns that \u201Csomewhere\u201D has access to all your messages and the data of your users, so you should pick a provider that you can trust.</p><p>Here is a (simplified) diagram of how the setup will look in the end when Alice contacts your bot:</p><div class="language-asciiart ext-asciiart"><pre class="language-asciiart"><code>_________        sends a         ____________                    ____________

If you need to connect to a funky database or do other low-level system-related things, chances are extremely high that you can do it with Node.js. Deno is relatively new, so it is sometimes still lacking support for some advanced things.
